Boot.MultiTenancy

Contains Boot.Multitenancy core, a Model test and a web project.

The typical structure resembles as follow:

- Boot.Multitenancy, Core 
 -- Boot-ModelFactory, Models separated in it's own dll to avoid problems with references later.
 -- Boot.Web, A test web mvc 4.5.1 project. Including a custom ViewPage<T> with additional helper included.
    These helpers makes it possible to use for eg. @Zone(Region.Content) without wrapping it with @Html.
