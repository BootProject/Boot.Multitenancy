Multitenancy

Package Boot.MultiTenancy 

This package is an extension of nHibernate's ISessionFactory and 
makes it incredible easy to use multiple session within the same 
application. In BootCms it is used to define different domains 
and their databases.

The setup is really easy, but you can of course customize it in 
any way you like. The SessionFactoryContainer want just a Key 
and a ISessionFactory, typically an Fluent or nHibenate config.
