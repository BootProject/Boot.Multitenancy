<h1>Host</h1>

<p>The Host is responsible for creating Tenants. Host is implemented as a Singleton, because there can be only one Host that contain Tenants.</p>

<h2>There are several ways to create a Tenant.</h2>

<h3>Web.config</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The regular way is to use Host.Init(). This require a minimum effort in web.config. <a href="webconfiguration">Read more</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Built in Tenant</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second way is to create a dictionary of Tenants and persist these to Init(Dictionay<Key, ITenant>).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Create your own Tenant</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The third way is to write your own Tenant and provide them as a Dictionay<Key, YourClassNameOfYourTenant>.</p>
